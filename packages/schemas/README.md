# PDTF Schemas
This repository contains the versioned schemas for the Property Data Trust Framework (PDTF) for digital residential property data exchange in England and Wales.

The aim of the framework is to enable the frictionless exchange of property data between software products and services, supported by trusted information regarding the provenance of that data.

The short term goal for the schema is to encompass all of the requirements of the [Home Buying and Selling Group](https://homebuyingandsellinggroup.co.uk) 'Property Pack', starting with the Buyers and Sellers Property Information set ([BASPI v4.0](https://homebuyingandsellinggroup.co.uk/baspi/)).

A parallel repository for this one has been created for the [Open API Specifications](https://github.com/Property-Data-Trust-Framework/api) for the data exchanges themselves, which will evolve independently.
