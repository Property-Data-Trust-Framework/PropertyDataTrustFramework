# Open API Specifications

This repository contains the versioned Open API Specifications for the Property Data Trust Framework (PDTF) for digital residential property data exchange in England and Wales.

The aim of the framework is to enable the frictionless exchange of property data between software products and services, supported by trusted information regarding the provenance of that data.

The API spec is designed to allow software products and services to have a standard way of creating and reading data as structured in accordance with the related [PDTF JSONSchema](https://github.com/Property-Data-Trust-Framework/schemas)

#### API standard
* The PDTF API aligns closely to gov.uk's [API technical and data standards (v2 - 2019)](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/gds-api-technical-and-data-standards)
